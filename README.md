Write code to represent a fair and a loaded die.

## Part 1 Implementation

### Fair Die
The fair die should accept a number of sides as an integer. It should have a `roll()` method that returns the side rolled.

### Loaded Die
The loaded die should accept a number of sides (int), a number representing the weighted side (int) and the weight of the weighted side (int). 
For example, sides=2, weighted_side=2, weight=4 means side 2 of the 2-sided die has a 4/5 probability of being rolled.

## Part 2 Testing

Test the fair die and the loaded die.
